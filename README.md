# My Portfolio

## Background 
Thanks for checking out my page! I am a Blockchain Engineer based out of Broooklyn, NY and I have a background in Environmental Geology. I look to work in the Web 3 space and specifically love communities that look towards blockchain for sustainability tracking/software. Feel free to reach out for any questions or to collaborate on side projects.
